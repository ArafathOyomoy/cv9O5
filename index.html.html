<h3>things i like and things that define's me:</h3>
<p>IM  a person more like spritual, i dont no if its a false thinking of mine but i would like to be alone i like to be anonymous and roam unknow places and sometimes a bit mild pain and lonliness makes this soul alive. the smell of nature ,the smell of soil and the pain in walking thousand of miles.<br>
i wanna sit on the mountain and see the horizion of green  mild cold win and pain flowing throw and finding the purpose of time and life and the emotion that alwys hunt i wanna appreciate and close my eye feel the every touches in my cell , i wanna feel livley ,feel lost <br>
though it doest mean that i dont love where im now but its thing that you cant never explain what heart s about and what makes it happy sometimes th pain emotion and being lost makes it i dont what this word should called but cant say happy either. <br>
 <strong>I dream to travel the whole world with myself  and a bag , travell through the deepest unknown and places feel lively and and i want touch the top of life</strong>
